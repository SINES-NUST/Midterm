initialize variables for "GC_content" and DNA sequences which do not contain "GC"
let's say "regular_sequences"
for each sequence in the DNA:
if the sequence contains "GC":
    update the "GC_content"
to this sequence
if the sequence does not contain "GC":
    update the "regular_sequences"
    display the sequences with GC as "GC_content" 
    and the sequences without GC as "regular_sequences"
