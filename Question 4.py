# Step 1
Define a function gc content of Dna which consists of guanine, cytosine and nucleotide.
get percentage of sequence of the gc Content 
set gc content of dna into a list of integers
gc content of dna equals value of guanine, cytosine and nucleotide
results equals gc content of dna
display results

# Step 2
Define a function longest sequence
get values for the functon longest sequence from the percentage of sequence of the gc Content
set values for the function longest sequence
if the sequence is greater than 30
    dispalys longest sequence
else
    display it is not a longest sequence
