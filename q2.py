create two lists one for "lower_sales" and one for "average_sales"
for each employee:
    assign variables for "lower_sales" and "average_sales" as the lowest and average sales in the lists
    for each employee's "lower_sales":
        if the sales are lower than the current "lower_sales" update the "lower_sales" to this mark
        if the sales are higher than the current "average_sales" update the "average_sales" to this mark
        display the lowest sale "lower_sales" and the average sale "average_sales"
