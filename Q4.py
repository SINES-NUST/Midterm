Part1: Writing Pseudo code for it.
Create a list of GC and AT contents of a DNA sequence.
Input a target variable 'GC content'
Set 'GC content' (percentage of sequence madeup of either G or C nucleotides)
Calculate GC content by comparing to the all G or C nucleotides and their percentage is calculated.
Display GC content.
#Code for it will be:
DNA_sequence = ['GC', 'AT']
GC_content = ['G nucleotide', 'C nucleotide']
#separating GC by using %age as reference
Print(GC_content)



Part2: pseudocode
Create a sorted list of 'arr' of DNA sequences
Input target variable as 'Longest sequence'
Set 'shortest' to 0 and 'longest' to length of 'arr'
If sequence 1 > sequence 2
set sequence 1 as max
If sequence 2 > sequence 1
set sequence 2 as max
If sequence 3 > max
set sequence 3 as max
If sequence 4 > max
set sequence 4 as max
If sequence 5 > max 
set sequence 5 as max
Write 'The max is'
Display 'max'
#code
Array = np.array[('sequence1','sequence2','sequence3','sequence4','sequence5')]
Longest_sequence = np.max[(array[0])]
#Longest sequence will be printed
