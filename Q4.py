#Part 1
DNA_Seq is a list
G is equal to guanine in DNA_Seq
C is equal to cytosine in DNA_Seq
SET GC_content is equal to percentage 
percentage is equal to G divided by C and multiply by 100

#Part 2
SET x is equal to longest sequence 
    FOR item(seq) in DNA_Seq
        IF item (seq) is equal to x
            Display Longest sequence (x)
        break
