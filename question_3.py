assumption: ahmed knows his spending raneg is as followed:
food = 500 - 1000 ruppees/day 
transport = 1000 - 1500 ruppees/day
Entertainment = 1500 - 2000 ruppees/day

1- creating a list called my_expenses that includes all of ahmed's daily spendings.
2- creating a loop that says for values in my_expenses:
    if value >= 500 and value <= 1000:
        add value to list called food
        print("food expense is:", food)
    elif value >= 1000 and value < 1500:
        add value to list called transport
        print("transport expense is:", transport)
    elif value >= 1500 and value < 2000:
        add value to list called entertainment
        print("entertainment expense is:", entertainment)
    else:
        print("Miscellaneous expense, Recheck!")
